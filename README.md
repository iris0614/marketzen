## Deployment

For custom domain configuration, please refer to the "Custom Domain" section below.

---

## Custom Domain

To set up a custom domain like `marketzen.com`, you need to meet the following requirements:

1. **You must own (register) the domain**  
   - You need to purchase and own `marketzen.com` from a domain registrar (such as Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.).

2. **Bind the domain to your Vercel project**  
   - Add the custom domain in the Vercel dashboard or via command line (you tried this before, but got a permission error, indicating you don't own this domain yet).

3. **Configure DNS resolution**  
   - In your domain registrar's backend, point the domain's DNS records to the CNAME or A records provided by Vercel.

4. **Wait for DNS to take effect**  
   - Usually takes a few minutes to several hours.

**If you just want a memorable free domain**  
You can use Vercel's subdomain, such as  
**[https://marketzen-app.vercel.app](https://marketzen-app.vercel.app)**  
This has been successfully bound and can be used directly!
